SharpDevelop release process:

[Christoph]:
 * Ensure GlobalAssemblyInfo.template has the correct version number and no 'beta' marker
 * Update /doc/readme.rtf if necessary
 * Upload files from build server to SourceForge
 * For non-beta releases: Set new release as default on SourceForge
 * Update http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Changes.aspx
 * Update http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/
 * Publish release announcement

[Daniel]:
 * Create and push signed git tag
     (side effect: this automatically causes UDC to recognize the release)
 * Mark version as released in issue tracker (move unresolved issues to next release)
 * Not necessarily for every release: publish new AvalonEdit version on NuGet and CodeProject
